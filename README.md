Citi Bike Data Analysis Project

We will be applying numerous classification, regression, and clustering models to the publicly available New York City "Citi Bike" system data. 

We hope to capture trends in usage of the bike share system, and explore interesting patterns in users and trip durations / locations.

Ultimately, we hope to be able to identify bike allocation patterns and create a heuristic for improving the overall system.
